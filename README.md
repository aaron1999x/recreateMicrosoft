# Microsoft Homepage Practice

This is a practice project where i recreated my own version of the Microsoft homepage using HTML5/CSS and a little JS for the sidebar menu. Modern CSS techniques such as CSS grid, flexbox and responsive media queries are also used.

- Most of the buttons do not work. However the website is responsive. The website will scale accordingly when it is viewed on a table or phone.
- JS is involved when view on a phone (_700px_). Navigation bar will be gone and a side menu will pop up when the menu button is clicked (_located on the top right_)
